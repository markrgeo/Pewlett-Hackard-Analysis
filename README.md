# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview of the analysis: 

The first analysis conducted provides an overview of the number of current employees who are reaching retirement age across the various divisions and job roles at Pewlett Hackard. There is an overview of the number of individuals within each department who are of retirement age, and there is also a more specific table which identifies everyone who is part of that cohort of potential retirees.
The second analysis provides a list of employees who are in a position to mentor new recruits to the company, and help make those hires job-ready by sharing their knowledge and details of their experiences.

•	Senior engineers (25,916) and senior staff (24,926) together make up 70.16% of the workers who are coming up to retirement age. 
•	There were 1549 employees who have the capacity to be moved into a mentoring role for new employees coming into the company.
•	There are also two managers who are likely to be retiring. Succession planning for those individuals will need to be a priority, as management will need to oversee the recruitment and training for the many people needed to be brought into the organization over the coming years.


Summary: 

•	With 72,458 individuals expected to retire, there will need to be a concentrated effort placed on recruitment. Management and human resources will be required to find ways to fill those vacancies, and ideally with internal promotions. 
•	The number of mentors available will not be enough to properly train the many people needed to keep Pewlett Hackard operating with the current level of staffing.
•	An additional study of the number of capable, tenured employees who would be capable of moving into the many vacant senior roles would be useful in order to sustain operations.
•	Also, a report focusing in on the retiring cohort to try to identify more closely how many people we expect to lose each year, over a five-year span could help to bolster the number of mentors we have available to train new staff or help those moving up in the organization to become quickly acclimatized to the work.
